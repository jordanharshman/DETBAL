# DETBAL
R code for the detailed balancing software (DETBAL), which is found in the "Illegal Reaction Loops.RMD" file.

This software is to be used by chemists who wish to check that their proposed reaction mechanisms followed Wegscheider's condition and do not contain illegal loops, principles of detailed balancing (see Stanbury & Hoffman, 2019 doi:10.1021/acs.jpca.9b03771; for details). Users will need to download R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) in order to run the .RMD file. If you are new to R, you will also need to download the R packages once in R to successfully run the software.
